In the middle of the 4th semester of my engineering, I got one idea and started working on it. it's about making customised outfits according to the consumer body measurements and designs.

I discussed the idea with my 3F's  =>  friends, family, followers.
I asked them one question. "have you got any readymade outfit whether in online or offline with your perfect measurements along with customisations.
the answer I got was No.
Anyone who wants to make their startup should follow below quote

"Start with a Prototype, Follow with an MVP and Then Get to the Final Product" - Chaduvula Prasanth.

I started working on my prototype at the end of my 4th semester.  I got an order of customised Tshirts for my university annual college fest.
which was a sort of 20,000 rupees. 
After successful delivery of Tshirts and my 4th-semester exams started working on MVP.
By running a prototype, got user feedback and reviews about customisations.

"To build a successful startup. you should be the sheep and your consumers will be the shepherd. they will guide you and you have to build according to their needs" - Chaduvula Prasanth. 

I went to three +2 colleges which are based out of my village and pitched the idea and started discussing with their students about how they can get customised college apparels without going to shops and running around untimely tailors.

In the first college, students showed their interest asking us how they can order the things. we just said give us measurements and choose the model.
Surprisingly we got 35 orders on our first. But on our second we got 80 orders and day by day it went increasing and these college kids started recommending us to their other college friends.

"Whether you are starting dot com or building an app, Look at your product and say is this get incredible word of mouth with a stranger to recommend this to her friend. if the answer is no, go back and build it again." - Chaduvula Prasanth. 

finally, we got 1500 orders from the three colleges and with an 87% student occupancy in each college and made 1.2 million INR.
