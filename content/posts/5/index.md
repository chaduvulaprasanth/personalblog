Creating anything from small pen to a million-dollar company or writing a program to a high rated blog post, everyone who wants to be dominant and stand out of the market should make products which are remark worthy.

Whatever it is identify the problem, create the solution which will give you great insight and remark worthy

Now let's talk about insight, marketing and advertising 
Competition is growing to grow

If you see the car industry Volkswagen group and Toyota group are fighting neck and neck to be number one, each has a 20% market share and GM is 19% market share and Honda is little less and so on so forth.

If I see in most of the businesses, pharmaceutical businesses in India 10 companies are neck-and-neck and in the largest company may have 12% market share and the second one has 10% market share and the third one 8% market share  and so on so forth

You would imagine if the competition is growing to grow that all the companies would be very closely bunched together. All the big companies would fight neck and neck with each other 

But something very strange and different has happened and it has changed the world in the last five years.  this is the world I want to talk to you about and there is a really big change. 

So if I take the world of cars where  I told you Volkswagen group and Toyota are fighting neck-and-neck and I move to the world of luxury electric cars which is a more modern development there one brand Tesla, has 98% market share, number two is BMW with 1% market share.

If I take the old world of drinks where Coca-Cola and Pepsi fighting neck each of them is out advertising  the other but I take the modern equivalent energy drinks which is the biggest brand red-bull which has 47% market share  and Coca-Cola and Pepsi energy drinks together have 14% market share   

If I take the world of fashion there are so many brands out there but today the world’s largest fashion brand for women is Zara, which is 10 times larger than Calvin Klein which is 21  billion dollar market share.
 
Let's come into the digital world. 

In search engines No.1  google. Which is No.2? the thing is you can’t name more than 2 or 3 search engines.

In social networking No.1 Facebook. Which is No.2?

In mobile chat No.1 is  WhatsApp.  No.2?

Essentially when you can name 10 pharmaceutical companies in India, you can't name more than three search engines in the world. 

You can't name more than three mobile chats in the world.

You can't name more than three social networks in the world.

Let's take market places in the world,  No.1 is Amazon. No.2??
in dating No.1 is Tinder. No.2??

In video sites No.1 is youtube. No.2??

We don’t know about No.2 and No.3 because they probably have a 5% market share.
the very interesting thing is the dominance of dominance. earlier you had lots of compilation. Today you have this incredible opportunity to create a huge market leader with a huge market share.

So the interesting thing in all these cases, there is an opportunity to build a large No.1, you don't have to stay small.
all these brands we talk about Tesla, Redbull,  Zara, Google, Gmail,  WhatsApp. the unique about these brands is they have never advertised
the looser brands that ones that advertise these days. winners don't need to advertise.  
The uniqueness of all these brands they capture the imagination of people like you, so somebody told you to try and use it.

You have never seen a Gmail Advertisement but somebody said to you about Gmail.
you have never seen a Whatsapp Advertisement but somebody said to you about Whatsapp.
that's the secret of today's winning companies is they don’t advertise. what does that mean if you don’t advertise it means you don’t need to spend money. you don't need money to start with.

If you need to advertise you need to die

Can you build something so lovable, so delightful and so remark worthy that users can't stop talking about it?

Whether you are starting a blog or a small flourish shop or a making a feature film or small educational teaching company. you are starting dot com or building an app whatever you are doing the secret is just look like this. Look at your product and say is this get incredible word of mouth with a stranger to recommend this to her friend. if the answer is no, go back and build it again.

Get some insight into the problem. the great lesson out here is winners get word of mouth and the loser will need to advertise and spend money that they don't have.
