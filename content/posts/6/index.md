90% of startups fail in their first five years but the reaming 1% will fly.

To start anything you have to leave your comfort zone first.

Either you are working with your project for a portfolio or startup, you should follow only one rule to build from zero to one. Start with a Prototype, Follow with an MVP and Then Get to the Final Product

"A prototype is a representation of the product soul in a raw way" - Chaduvula Prasanth

When I started making a prototype about customised apparel. I made a form and got orders for customisations.
keep one thing in mind. Always prototype is to get early adopter's feedback to build your MVP.

[While running my prototype, I got an order of customised Tshirts for my university annual college fest. which was a sort of 20,000 rupees.](https://chaduvulaprasanth.netlify.com/how-i-made-1-2-million-inr-with-zero-investment-in-36-days-from-a-rural-village)

After collecting user feedback start making your MVP of the product.

“Your entire success will be based on 1 or 2 features, no more.”- Fred Lalonde, Hopper Co-Founder.
which means the beauty of having a growing user base is - you start getting a lot of feedback & feature requests. The challenge is they can completely change product strategy if you let them.

To make MVP of my product I just used twko chat tool where customers can chat with us to get their orders done. [we got 1500 orders from the three colleges and with an 87% student occupancy in each college and made 1.2 million INR.](https://chaduvulaprasanth.netlify.com/how-i-made-1-2-million-inr-with-zero-investment-in-36-days-from-a-rural-village)

When you are working on MVP of your startup product. "if you truly want to stand out, you need to strive toward creating a minimum lovable product instead"

Once you got your early valuable users, now "your job should be defining what needs to be built to delight user" - Chaduvula Prasanth

In the initial stage of the startup, built your core features and release it to your users. To make it a successful startup. you should be the sheep and your consumers will be the shepherd. they will guide you and you have to build according to their needs.
