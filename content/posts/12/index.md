## Redux Flow

### Getting Started with Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
<br/>
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).
<br/>
You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org/), or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
